# SDG Index and Dashboards Report for European Cities  
## Prototype Version
City-level data from 2019 Index and Dashboards

## Report Description
The Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN), which co-produces the Global Sustainable Development Report (formerly SDG Index and Dashboards), in partnership with the Brabant Center for Sustainable Development (Telos, Tilburg University), released the first-ever SDG Index and Dashboards Report for European Cities.

The report compares the performance of capital cities and a selection of large metropolitan areas in the European-Union (EU) and European Free Trade Association (EFTA) on the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In total, results for 45 European cities are presented in this first prototype version using 56 indicators. The report includes contributions from Nilda Mesa (Center for Sustainable Urban Development, Columbia University), the OECD and European Commission, and urban policymakers.
